                BRIEF HISTORY
        </h3>
        <div id="history-content">
            <p id="history-article">Because of the Philippine Constabulary during 1900’s Barangay Camp Henry T. Allen was built. At first it is known as Constabulary hill, it was then renamed Camp Henry T. Allen in honor for the first chief of the Philippine Constabulary. In 1908, the Philippine Military Academy was moved in Baguio city at Constabulary Hill and now known as the Barangay Camp Henry T. Allen. After 28 years, in 1936, the Philippine Military Academy was moved to Teacher’s Camp and again decided to move to Camp Henry T. Allen before the World War 2 resumed. In honor with the first chief of the Philippines Constabulary, the barangay was named after him. Before, the only people that are allowed to reside here are those that are in the Military but after several years, civilians can already take part inside the barangay. Due to the lack of training grounds, the PMA was then moved to its home in Fort Gregorio Del Pillar which is located in Loakan, Baguio City.
